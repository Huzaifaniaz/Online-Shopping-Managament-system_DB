Description:
This GitHub repository contains the source code and related resources for an Online Shopping Management System. It is a web-based application designed to facilitate efficient and seamless online shopping operations. The system offers a user-friendly interface for customers to browse and select products, while also providing administrators with tools to manage inventory, orders, and customer data effectively.

The Online Shopping Management System encompasses key features that enhance the shopping experience for customers and streamline administrative tasks. Users can easily register and authenticate their accounts, enabling personalized shopping and order tracking. The system includes a comprehensive product catalog that showcases product details, such as images, descriptions, pricing, and availability. Customers can search, filter, and sort products based on their preferences.

The shopping cart functionality allows customers to add desired items, review their selections, and proceed to a secure checkout process. The system handles order placement, payment processing, and order confirmation, ensuring a smooth transaction experience.

Administrators have access to an order management dashboard, where they can efficiently process and track customer orders. They can update order statuses, generate invoices, and manage inventory levels accordingly. The system also facilitates inventory management, allowing administrators to add new products, update stock quantities, and handle variations such as sizes or colors. Low-stock notifications enable timely restocking of products.

Additionally, the system incorporates user reviews and ratings, enabling customers to provide feedback on products. This information aids other users in making informed purchase decisions and helps improve product selection.

The repository includes the source code implementation using web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a backend framework such as PHP, Python, or Node.js. SQL scripts are provided for database setup and population. Documentation is available with detailed instructions for deployment, configuration, and usage. A concise PowerPoint presentation highlights the system's key features, and a business development report offers insights into the market analysis, target audience, and potential business opportunities associated with the system.

Contributions from the open-source community are encouraged to enhance the system's functionality, security, and user experience. Please refer to the project's documentation and guidelines for contributing and reporting issues.

Note: Frontend implementation and user interface design may be available in a separate repository or project.
